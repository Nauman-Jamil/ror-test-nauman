# Participatory Budgeting System - Complete Implementation

A comprehensive Rails-based participatory budgeting system that implements **all three features** from the ROR Contract Hiring Round 2 Assignment 1: Participatory Budgeting Enhancements.

## ðŸŽ¯ All Features Implemented

### âœ… 1. Budget Category Limits & Spending Controls

- **Business Problem**: Organizations need to limit spending within specific budget categories (e.g., maximum 40% for infrastructure, 30% for social programs)
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Added `spending_limit_percentage` field to budget categories
  - âœ… Implemented real-time budget allocation validation during voting
  - âœ… Created admin interface for setting and monitoring category limits
  - âœ… Added visual indicators showing category utilization rates
- **Demo Focus**: Show voting process with limit enforcement, admin monitoring dashboard

### âœ… 2. Multi-Phase Budget Voting

- **Business Problem**: Organizations want to run budget voting in phases (e.g., pre-selection, final voting, implementation tracking)
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Extended budget component to support multiple voting phases
  - âœ… Added phase-specific configurations (voting rules, participant eligibility)
  - âœ… Implemented automatic phase transitions based on conditions
  - âœ… Created phase-specific reporting and analytics
- **Demo Focus**: Show phase transitions, different voting behaviors per phase, reporting

### âœ… 3. Budget Impact Assessment Integration

- **Business Problem**: Organizations need to collect and display impact metrics for budget proposals
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Created impact metrics model (estimated beneficiaries, timeline, sustainability score)
  - âœ… Built impact assessment form for project creators
  - âœ… Added impact-based filtering and sorting for voters
  - âœ… Generated impact reports for approved projects
- **Demo Focus**: Show impact data collection, voter filtering, impact reporting

### Sample Budgets with Phases

- **City Annual Budget 2024** ($1,000,000): Multi-phase participatory budgeting
- **Community Development Fund** ($250,000): Neighborhood-level initiatives

### Multi-Phase Voting Examples

- **Proposal Collection Phase**: Citizens submit budget proposals
- **Final Voting Phase**: Active voting with real-time validation
- **Implementation Tracking Phase**: Progress monitoring and feedback

### Impact Assessment Data

- **Beneficiaries**: Number of people impacted
- **Timeline**: Implementation duration in months
- **Sustainability**: Long-term impact scores (1-10)
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Cost per beneficiary
- **Accessibility**: Ease of access scores (1-10)

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

### 1. Budget Category Limits

- Navigate to "Categories" to see spending limits
- Create allocations and watch real-time validation
- See visual indicators when categories exceed limits
- Monitor utilization rates with progress bars

### 2. Multi-Phase Voting

- Go to any budget and click "Phases"
- Create different voting phases with specific rules
- Set participant eligibility and voting rules
- Watch automatic phase transitions based on dates
- View voting statistics and participation rates

### 3. Impact Assessment

- From budget allocations, click "Impact"
- Add impact metrics for beneficiaries, timeline, sustainability
- View impact scores and filtering options
- Generate impact reports for approved projects

### 4. Complete Workflow Demo

1. **Create Budget**: Set total amount and categories
2. **Set Category Limits**: Define spending percentages
3. **Create Phases**: Set up multi-phase voting process
4. **Add Allocations**: Create budget allocations with validation
5. **Assess Impact**: Add impact metrics for each allocation
6. **Vote**: Participate in voting phases with real-time feedback
7. **Monitor**: Track progress and utilization rates

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Models & Relationships

- **Budget**: Manages budget metadata and total amounts
- **BudgetCategory**: Defines categories with spending limit percentages
- **BudgetAllocation**: Links budgets to categories with amounts
- **BudgetPhase**: Manages multi-phase voting workflows
- **BudgetVote**: Tracks votes in different phases
- **ImpactMetric**: Stores impact assessment data

### Key Features

```ruby
# Category limit validation
def category_limit_not_exceeded
  unless budget.can_allocate_to_category?(budget_category, amount)
    errors.add(:amount, "would exceed category limit")
  end
end

# Phase transition logic
def auto_transition
  case status
  when 'draft'
    update(status: 'active') if start_date <= Date.current
  when 'active'
    update(status: 'completed') if end_date < Date.current
  end
end

# Impact score calculation
def impact_score
  metrics = impact_metrics
  return 0 if metrics.empty?
  metrics.sum(:metric_value) / metrics.count
end
```

### Visual Indicators

- Progress bars for budget utilization
- Color-coded category limits (red for over-limit)
- Phase status indicators (draft/active/completed)
- Impact score badges (high/medium/low)
- Real-time validation feedback
